# Express Note Taker

## Description

```
I was tasked with building the backend of this project to familiarize myself with ExpressJS, Insomnia, 
and Heroku with the provided front end starter code.
The goal was to give the note taker application a save functionality, with a JSON file that stores each
note with a unique id.
I included the bonus user-ability to delete notes that were previously added to our notes list.
I learned how to implement the get, push, and delete http methods on my own server using node's express module. 
I struggled with knowing how to get this project to deploy through Heroku, and with the new file structure.
```
## Installation:
````
The following packages are required to run this application:

    Express
