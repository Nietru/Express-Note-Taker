# Express Note Taker

## Description

```
I built the backend of this project to familiarize myself with ExpressJS, Insomnia, and Heroku with the provided front end starter code.
The goal was to give the note taker application a save functionality, with a JSON file that stores each note with a unique id.
I included the bonus user-ability to delete notes that were previously added to our notes list.
I learned how to implement the get, push, and delete http methods on my own server using node's express module. I struggled with knowing how to get
this project to deploy through Heroku and with the new file structure.
```

## Usage:

```
Requires having node and express installed through the command-line, as well as a heroku account with the ability to sign in.
Required node packages can be found at the top of the server.js file.
This project can be tested out in the browser.
